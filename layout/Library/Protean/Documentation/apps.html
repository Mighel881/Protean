	  <p>The applications section of Protean allows you to add icons, or <em>glyphs</em>, for individual applications to the status bar. These applications will appear when the selected application has a notification. This can be accomplished by selecting an application from the list of installed applications, in the below example we will be selecting the Cydia application.</p>

	  <h3 align="center"><strong>Selecting an Application</strong></h3>
	  <p>There are two ways you can find an application. The first being that you simply scroll down until you lcoate the application you're wanting to select from the list of installed applications.</p>
	  <p>The second way you can select an application is through the search bar, which can be found at the top of the Applications page.</p>

On this screen you will are able to select the glyph you want to use for the application as well as the application's "Tap Action."</p>
	   <p>Tap Actions occur when you tap the application's glyph in the status bar.  Selecting "Launch Application" will cause the application to launch when you tap the glyph. If you select "Activator Action" you will be taken to a list of activator actions that you can select.</p>

You can start searching by typing into the search bar, located at the top of the page. Search results will begin displaying as soon as you've typed the first letter.</p>   
	 <p>Once you've selected you can press <em>Cancel</em> to exit the Search field.</p>
	 <p>After you have finished choosing the application's glyph and it's Tap Action you can go back to the list of your installed Applications by pressing <em>< Applications</em> in the top left hand corner.</p>

	<p>Now you won't see your application in the list of <em>Enabled Applications</em> just yet. In order for your newly enabled application to be shown we'll need to refresh the page. This can be done by simply going be to the main page of Protean and the selecting <em>Applications</em>.</p>
	 <p>As you can see, we now have Cydia listed as one of our <em>Enabled Applications</em>.<br /></p>
